# UX Training program by WeDevelop

### Goals

- Learn and put into practice the general concepts of the UX process and design of digital products.
- Learn the Design thinking methodology for user-centered product design.
- Learn and implement the Lean work methodology, with quick iterations and validations.
- Encourage interaction and continuous feedback with the product owner and the development team.
- Approach to a daily basis of remote work.

### What we'll be working on

Carry out an end-to-end UX / UI process, covering the initial stage of research and validation of ideas, definition, creation and validation of flows, up to the interface design of a digital product.

### The project

Design a proposal for a rewards app oriented to a workplace, in which:
- A Team leader can set short and long term objectives for a project and prizes to be won according to those objectives;
- Members of the product development team can win these awards and receive them at home.

### How to use this program

This program will be divided into blocks that can last up to 2/3 weeks each.

The first part of each block is theorical, and will either introduce you to new concepts or help you review things that you've probably already learned. Concepts will be introduced in the way of links, books, videos, etc. All we provide is a guide, it's up to you to investigate further.
After finishing the learning part, you'll find a "Wrap-up" section. Use this time to ask any question you may have. Also, we'll connect you with different team members that will tell you how they use whatever you've just learned on a daily basis at working days. Finally, at the end of each block, you'll find a "Bonus" section.

We'll drop down there books, links, and any other information we consider important for you to have. We suggest taking note of that and learn a little more every day (you'll do this from now on if you're smart).

The second part of each block is practical, so you'll have to apply the learned concepts in the real life, to start moving forward with the project.

We suggest a duration for each block but take your time. It's better to take longer and really learn and apply the concepts rather than moving on with vague ideas about section's topics.
