### But, how do we work?
I'm adding this presentation here, to show a little bit how we work and the tools we use in our daily basis: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1B8gWoFIuFHLQaqqfgrDtKMnD1Qdx4pFYitWTG6QU4-4/edit?usp=sharing

  

### Wrap-up

Don't forget to ask any question you have. Also, contact Agos to get in touch with team members and learn how we use the things you've just learned.
Also, and after you've read all the content, we can set up a meeting with a project team, so you can learn more about the dynamics and methodologies we use.


### Bonus

These are some books I consider very good ones for you to read if you want to know more or expand your knowledge about the topics explained in this block.
