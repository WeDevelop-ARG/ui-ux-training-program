### Tools :sparkles:

Here's a list of the tools we're using and the do's and donâ€™t s of each one. You're going to receive an invite to join all of them. In case you didn't receive it, please get in touch with your tutors.

- **Mural:**
We use Mural in order to place information of the project and all the ideas that could arise during collaborative sessions. All the outcomes from the workshops should be included in the Training Program Mural Room. You don't have to create any personal murals. If you happen to need to create a new mural, please ask the tutor.

- **Google Workspace:**
We use the G Workspace in order to manage our daily work and our videocalls. Google Drive is used to save and write any extra documentation (like interviews and recordings). You don't have to save any file on your personal Google account; everything should be in the Training Program folder we provide. Please feel free to ask if you have doubts about folder management or how/when/why to create a file.

- **Slack:**
We use slack to communicate everyday. You're going to be invited to the WeDevelop's official slack channel. We manage a closed channel for the Training Program, but feel free to talk with any other company member or join any public channel we may have.

- **Figma:**
We use Figma to manage all our design projects. This means: Design project folders, Mid & High fidelity designs, invitations, collaborative design sessions, prototyping, user testing, handoffs, and more.  We're going to start using Figma once we reach to the wirefaming phase, but feel free to explore the tool or ask the tutor for tutorials or help using this tool in case you need it. You don't have to create any files on your personal Figma account. All files will be shared inside the WeDevelop's organization.
